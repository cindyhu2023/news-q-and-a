Question: 
Why were three Pennsylvania officers charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an 8-year-old?
Answer: 
The three Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania, police officers were charged with one count of voluntary manslaughter, one count of involuntary manslaughter and 10 counts of reckless endangerment [1] after they fired shots that struck four people leaving a high school football game, fatally injuring 8-year-old Fanta Bility [1]. The District Attorney's office believed manslaughter charges were appropriate rather than murder in the third degree because there was no evidence of malice [1].

Question: 
How is the reform-minded Los Angeles County DA, George Gascón, being threatened by package thefts and other high-profile crimes?
Answer: 
Los Angeles County District Attorney George Gascón is facing pushback from Union Pacific and other opponents due to his progressive criminal justice reforms, which include a directive not to prosecute many nonviolent misdemeanors such as trespassing [1]. This has been linked to package thefts from freight trains passing through downtown Los Angeles [1]. Gascón is also facing criticism for high-profile murders in the county, as well as a spate of smash-and-grab robberies before Christmas [4,5].

Question: 
Why was a bridge given an overall 'poor' rating by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation?
Answer: 
The Pennsylvania Department of Transportation website that tracks bridges across the state rated the Pittsburgh bridge that collapsed an "overall condition" of "poor" [1]. The Deck Condition and Superstructure Condition were both rated "4 - Poor," while the Substructure Condition was rated "6 - Satisfactory" [1]. This bridge had an overall "poor" rating due to the lowest condition rating of the primary components of a bridge being less than or equal to 4 [1].
