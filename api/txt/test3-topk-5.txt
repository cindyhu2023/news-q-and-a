Question: 
Why were three Pennsylvania officers charged with manslaughter in the fatal shooting of an 8-year-old?
Answer: 
Three Sharon Hill, Pennsylvania police officers were charged with one count of voluntary manslaughter, one count of involuntary manslaughter and 10 counts of reckless endangerment in connection with the shooting death of 8-year-old Fanta Bility while she exited a high school football game on August 27 [1].

Question: 
How is the reform-minded Los Angeles County DA, George Gasc贸n, being threatened by package thefts and other high-profile crimes?
