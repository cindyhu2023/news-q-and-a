Question: 
How is the reform-minded Los Angeles County DA, George Gascón, being threatened by package thefts and other high-profile crimes?
Answer: 
Union Pacific has blamed the package thefts on Gascón and his reforms, claiming that 100 arrests have been made but no court proceedings initiated [1]. In response, Gascón has stood by his focus on rehabilitation and diversion of nonviolent suspects to treatment instead of prosecution [2]. This has resulted in pushback from the local deputy district attorney's union and accusations of unlawful policies [3].
