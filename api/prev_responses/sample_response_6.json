In a recent surgery, a genetically modified pig heart was transplanted into a 57-year-old man with terminal heart disease [1]. The surgery was deemed necessary because the patient was ineligible for a conventional heart transplant or an artificial heart pump [1]. The pig heart transplant was authorized by the US Food and Drug Administration [1]. However, the safety of pig heart transplants is still uncertain and the patient's recovery is uncertain [1,2]. The modified pig heart was designed to prevent rejection by the human immune system and excessive tissue growth [1,2]. Powerful anti-rejection drugs were also administered [2]. It is important for researchers to learn from this transplant to improve future transplants [1]. An independent review of the data and a research ethics committee were suggested to ensure the decision-making process and consent were appropriate [1].
